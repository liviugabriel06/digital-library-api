# 📚 Digital Library - Full Stack Application

**Digital Library** is a comprehensive Full Stack web application designed to simulate a real-world library management system. It features a robust Java Spring Boot backend, a modern React frontend, and a PostgreSQL database, all containerized for easy deployment.

The application manages the entire lifecycle of library operations: book inventory, user authentication, borrowing/returning workflows, and administrative oversight.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🎨 Frontend (React + Bootstrap)
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Modern, responsive design built with React, Vite, and Bootstrap.
* **Authentication System:** Secure Login and Registration pages with role-based redirection.
* **Dynamic Dashboard:**
    * **Public View:** Browse the book catalog with search filters.
    * **User View:** Borrow books and manage personal active loans ("My Loans").
    * **Admin View:** Exclusive access to the Admin Dashboard for inventory management.
* **Smart Search & Filters:** Real-time searching by book title.
* **Visual Inventory:** Books are displayed with cover images for an enhanced user experience.

### ⚙️ Backend (Spring Boot + PostgreSQL)
* **Smart Stock Management:** Automatically tracks `Total Copies` vs. `Available Copies`. Borrowing a book decrements stock instantly.
* **Transactional Integrity:** Uses `@Transactional` to ensure data consistency during complex operations (borrowing/returning).
* **Validation Rules:**
    * Prevents borrowing if stock is 0.
    * Prevents duplicate active loans for the same book by the same user.
    * Prevents deleting a book if it currently has active loans history.
* **Secure API:** REST endpoints protected by Basic Authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

## 🚀 Setup & Execution

### 1. Database Configuration
The application relies on a PostgreSQL database running in a Docker container.

**Run the following command to start the DB:**
```bash
docker run --name digital-library-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=digitallibrary -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Java)

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Navigate to the backend folder.
3. Run DigitalLibraryApplication.java.
4. The API will start on http://localhost:8080.


### 3. Frontend Setup (React)

1. Open a terminal in the frontend folder.
2. Install dependencies (first time only).

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```


## 🔐 Security & User Roles
The API is secured using Basic Authentication. You must register users first to interact with the protected endpoints.


| Role | Access Level | Capabilities |
|:-----|:-------------|:-------------|
|Admin| Full Control |  • Add, Edit, Delete Books </br> • Manage Inventory & Stock </br>• View All Loans |
|User|Restricted|   • View Book Catalog </br> • Borrow Books </br> • Return Books </br> • View Personal History|


How to create accounts: Use the Register page in the application.
* Select "Student(User)" for a standard account.
* Select "Librarian(Admin)" to access administrative features.
